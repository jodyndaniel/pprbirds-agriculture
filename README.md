# Determinants of wetland- bird community composition in agricultural marshes of the Northern Prairie and Parkland Region
Here, we examine whether landscape context is more important in predicting which wetland bird assemblage a wetland will support.
We asked:
* are distinct assemblages of birds occupying these wetlands,
* if so, which species, functional traits and  habitat traits at the local- and landscape-level are related to each assemblage; and 
* whether bird assemblages could be used to indicate the level of agricultural disturbance affecting a prairie-pothole wetland.
